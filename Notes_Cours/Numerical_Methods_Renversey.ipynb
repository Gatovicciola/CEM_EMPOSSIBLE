    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maxwell's equations coupled with constitutive relations provide an accurate quantitative description of ligth propagration in Ⲗ-scale or bigger structures.\n",
    "Consequently, they can be used to design and to optimize photonic devices through numerical simulations prior to the actual fabircation.\n",
    "We can think of these simulations as numerical experiments that mirror actual experiments. For example: scattering properties, or loss evaluation.\n",
    "*  Direct compuational techniques are also the heart engine of inversion methods.\n",
    "*  Using the extreme versatility allowed by numerical simulations, on can also define realze \"unphysical\" simulations that will nevertheless provide meaningful and usefil results (*citation)"
